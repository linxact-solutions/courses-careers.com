## Notes for Astro Implementation

1. **URL Structure**: Most content pages use numeric IDs with descriptive slugs (e.g., `7107-accountancy-courses-how-to-choose.html`)

2. **Component System**: The site appears to use a Joomla-style component system with articles categorized by ID (2 for student-advice, 5 for undergraduate)

3. **Static Assets**: 
   - Images are stored in `/images/` with subdirectories for different content types
   - Templates and styling in `/templates/cms_cc_template_1.0/`
   - Module assets in `/modules/`

4. **Banner/Ad System**: There's a banner click tracking system under `/component/banners/click/` with 19 tracked banners

5. **Feed Support**: The site supports both RSS and Atom feeds through PHP parameters

This structure should provide a complete blueprint for recreating the site in Astro with proper routing and content organization.
