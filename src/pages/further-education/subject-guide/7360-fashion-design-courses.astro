							<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
								Studying fashion design is to enjoy an education and training that is demanding, challenging, and of the highest quality. British fashion education is regarded as the world's best in creativity, professionalism and diversity. Graduates are valued as innovators working towards the industry's future. Many graduates are offered positions with international designers and multi-national companies, in addition to the fortunate few who go on to become international names in their own right.
							</p>

							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
								This quality and reputation is the result of a strong emphasis on the development of the individual and an understanding of craft and business practice within the context of historical and contemporary culture. Students are presented with a dynamic mix of inspirations and considerations; never easy, but never dull.
							</p>

						<section id="routes" class="mb-8">
							<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What are the usual routes to studying Fashion design?</h2>
							
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
								Students are usually required to have studied GCSEs at school and then go on to take A levels or, in Scotland, Highers. All Fashion courses will accept the equivalent overseas qualifications. Alternatively, students may undertake equivalent vocational qualifications such as BTEC National Diplomas, or the Advanced GNVQ qualifications in Art and Design.
							</p>

							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
								Where students have pursued their education to A level standard, the next step is to apply for a one year Foundation programme. These courses offer a broad art and design experience, where time is spent in preparation for application to a chosen degree and finalising portfolio work suitable for submission and/or interview to an undergraduate course. Some Foundation courses allow students to specialise in their chosen area of design in the final term of the programme. Students are encouraged to investigate the variety of courses on offer and are guided through the application process.
							</p>

							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
								At the end of a typical foundation year, most graduates move on to either a two-year HND (Higher National Diploma) or a three or four year BA Honours course. Most BA courses take three years to complete, but some institutions offer a four-year sandwich course. This usually includes up to twelve months working on industrial placement, either as a one year block or as two six month periods. A number of three-year BA courses also include a short placement period within the curriculum, whilst all fashion courses dedicate time to working with the fashion industry in the form of sponsored projects, visits or visiting lecturers.
							</p>

							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
								Upon graduation, a number of fashion students choose to continue their education within a range of postgraduate courses on offer; Diploma, M.A., MPhil/PhD. This allows for either further specialism or related study.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section id="application" class="mb-8">
							<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How do I apply for a place?</h2>
							
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
								In order to gain a place on a typical course you will need a good portfolio which demonstrates your ability in drawing, design development, problem solving, colour work and interest in fashion. Some courses may wish to see examples of written work such as an essay or report, and some staff may wish to interview you by telephone. Courses may have different entry requirements and regulations, so, if possible, you should check prospectus information or course leaflets.
							</p>

							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
								Some BA courses will allow you entry direct to the second year if you have either the equivalent of an HND already, or you have prior experience within the fashion industry. Again, you should check with the courses you favour. You should also be able to submit your portfolio or 'slides' rather than posting the original work to the UK.
