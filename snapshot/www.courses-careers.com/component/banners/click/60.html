<p><strong>RULES FOR THE PARTICIPATION INTO THE INTERNATIONAL SELECTION</strong><br/>
<strong> MY REUSE DESIGN</strong><br/>
<strong> FIRST EDITION ACADEMIC YEAR 2011-2012</strong></p>
<p>Art. 1: Promoting Subjects and purpose of the selection</p>

1.2 The purpose of the selection is to assign 38 scholarships for attendance of Master programs for the 2011-2012 academic year, covering different amounts of the tuition fees of the program of choice.<br/>
1.3 This special project is open to all international candidates aged between 20 and 45 years eligible by the below mentioned requirements: students not residing in Italy or Spain. Italian and Spanish students residing abroad are considered international and therefore allowed to participate.<br/>
1.4 The selection involves the publication of the projects on http://creativediary.net/ after a first evaluation, and the scholarship assignment after the below mentioned deadline.<br/>
1.5 Projects should be sent by e-mail to: scholarships@ied.edu, no later than Tuesday, the 20th of September 2011, 23.59 (Italian time).</p>
<p>Art. 2: Theme<br/>
2.1 Description of the Theme: <strong>My Reuse Design</strong><br/>
IED calls young creatives to develop ideas and projects describing ‘My Reuse Design’: please apply the reuse concept to the area of studies that you prefer, Fashion, Design, Visual Communication, Management.<br/>
“Reuse” means using an item more than once, for the same function, or for a second life, when it is used for a different purpose. By reusing, we can create new shapes from old materials. Reuse helps saving time, money, energy, and resources, it can offer quality products to people and organizations with limited means, it can generate jobs and business activities that contribute to the economy. Reuse is a very important part of a sustainable behavior. Reusing is different from recycling, which consists in processing used materials for the production of new objects.<br/>
Reuse can consist of different actions:  remanufacturing (reconstructing the object), regiving/regifting (taking a gift and giving it to someone else), repurposing (changing the function of an object), and nearly everything we buy and consume can be reused: old metal cans, clothes, textiles, plastic bags, bicycle tires, packaging tools are just a few examples of objects that can generate creative reuse.<br/>
For each IED area a briefing has been defined.<br/>
Applicants must develop the theme relating to the area they wish to apply for (Fashion, Design, Visual Communication, Management); the choice of the element to design or describe depends on the course you chose and, when available, on the specialization you prefer.<br/>
In the section n. 5.4 you will find the technical details to present your projects, depending on the level of the Master program you chose.</p>
<p>Art. 3: Participation and Scholarships*<br/>
3.1 Individual students can participate in the selection; for every program, one scholarship, covering the 50% or the 100% of the tuition fees for the chosen program, will be assigned. The scholarships will be assigned, whatever the program of choice, only to the 38 students whose projects have been selected by the IED Jury. The decision about the level of coverage of the scholarship (100% or 50%) will be based exclusively on the level of quality of the project, with 100% scholarships reserved only to a maximum of 15 students and only if they meet the level of excellence established by the jury. In case the level of the projects, for one or more of the below mentioned programs, will not be considered sufficient, IED will not assign any scholarship.</p>
<p>The Master courses for which the scholarship can be granted are the following, listed by area:<br/>
