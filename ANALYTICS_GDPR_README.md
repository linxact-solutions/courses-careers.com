## Configuration

### Analytics Configuration

The analytics configuration is centralized in the `Layout.astro` file:

```typescript
<Analytics 
    ga4={{ measurementId: "G-XXXXXXXXXX" }}
    matomo={{ url: "https://analytics.courses-careers.com/", siteId: "1" }}
    hubspot={{ portalId: "XXXXXXXX" }}
    intercom={{ appId: "xxxxxxxx" }}
    optimizely={{ projectId: "XXXXXXXXX" }}
/>
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your actual tracking IDs:

```env
PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
PUBLIC_MATOMO_URL=https://analytics.courses-careers.com/
PUBLIC_MATOMO_SITE_ID=1
PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID=XXXXXXXX
PUBLIC_INTERCOM_APP_ID=xxxxxxxx
PUBLIC_OPTIMIZELY_PROJECT_ID=XXXXXXXXX
```

## Cookie Categories

### Necessary Cookies
- **Always enabled** - cannot be disabled
- Essential for website functionality
- Session management, security, accessibility

### Analytics Cookies
- Google Analytics 4 tracking
- Matomo analytics tracking
- User behavior analysis
- Performance monitoring

## Privacy Features

### Randomized Tracking IDs
All analytics providers use randomized tracking IDs to enhance privacy:

```typescript
function randomizeTrackingId(baseId: string): string {
  const random = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8);
  return `${baseId}-${random}`;
}
```

### Data Minimization
- Only collect data necessary for functionality
- Anonymize IP addresses
- Automatic data deletion after 26 months
- No persistent user identification without consent

### Cookie Cleanup
When users withdraw consent, the system automatically:
- Deletes all tracking cookies
- Clears localStorage data
- Removes tracking scripts
- Reloads the page to ensure clean state

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

The analytics system is automatically initialized in the layout:

```typescript
// Initialize analytics with user preferences
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
  const { initializeAnalytics } = await import('../lib/analytics');
  initializeAnalytics(config);
});
```

### Custom Event Tracking

Track custom events throughout your application:

```typescript
import { getAnalytics } from '../lib/analytics';

const analytics = getAnalytics();
if (analytics) {
  analytics.trackEvent('Course', 'View', 'Computer Science', 1);
}
```

### Page View Tracking

Page views are automatically tracked, but you can manually track them:

```typescript
const analytics = getAnalytics();
if (analytics) {
  analytics.trackPageView('/custom-path', 'Custom Page Title');
}
```
